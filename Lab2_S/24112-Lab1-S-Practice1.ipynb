    "### A Note on Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "Most documents only contain a small subset of the vocabulary, resulting in a very sparse data matrix.\n",
    "To handle the sparsity, in this exercise `data` is represented as a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`, which can store sparse matrices efficiently while still allowing efficient row-based indexing.\n",
    "You can learn more about `csr_matrix` and other ways of dealing with sparse matrices at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that `data` is **not** a normal NumPy array.\n",
    "While most operations will be the same as with a normal dense array, **you cannot use a sparse matrix to index another matrix**.\n",
    "If you need to do this, either first convert the matrix to a NumPy array with the `toarray()` method, or use methods specifically designed to work with sparse matrices."

    "Use your k-NN function with cosine distance. Design an appropriate and complete machine learning experiment, which should include the training, hyper-parameter selection and evaluation stages. In this case, your hyperparameter will be $k$. You can choose from the random subsampling, k-fold CV and LOO approaches for hyperparameter selection. In order to get 4 marks, you should implement this from scrach without using readily implemented data-split functions provided in existing libraries. If you decide to use existing implementation on data splitting, model selection and/or evaluation, you can get at most 2 marks. \n",
